are a lot unique and specific trait or elements that characterized data. X is a special

program that switches the processor from one process to another.

(a) Define what is X.
[1 mark]

(b) Name two main models that explains the states of processes. Name both models
accordingly.

[2 marks]

(c) Process termination stops and halts processes from executing properly. Provide

THREE (3) reasons that lead to the process termination.

Figure 3 below shows the processes’ traces from three processes: X, Y and Z

 

Figure 3 - Process traces for X,Y and Z

Starting address of x program : 70.

Maximum number of instruction cycle : 3 cycles.

Draw the combined trace of ALL the processes.

Question 4

(a)

(b)

Various input/output (I/O) devices are divided into THREE (3) main

categories.

(1) Name THREE (3) categories of I/O devices.
[3 marks]

(11) Specify any TWO (2) aspects or areas that differentiate thee I/O devices.
[2 marks]

There are several disk scheduling algorithms that could be used to ensure
performance of the disk I/O is optimized. Some of the common ones are FIFO,
SSTF and SCAN.

Head initial position: Track 75

Disc track request: 59, 73, 10, 170, 145, 30, 81, 120, 60, 24

Head movement: Decreasing.

Question 5

Earlier computer machines utilize partitioning as early method of memory

management. Partitioning can be divided into two types, fixed partitioning, and Z

partitioning.

(a)

(b)

(c)

Define what is Z partitioning.
{1 mark]

Fixed partitioning is further divided into TWO (2) types. List down ALL of

them.

Buddy system is another alternate strategy of memory management. It treats

available spaces as single block, and Splits into two equal buddies as required

by the processes. Based on the given condition in Figure 5 below, draw the

buddy system representation of memory allocation management.

Total amount of RAM 1000 KB/1 MB
First process to arrive, Process A — request for 122KB.
Second process arrive, Process B — request for 75KB.
Third process to arrive, Process C — request for 200KB.
Release process C.
Release process A.
Release process B.
