Deadlocks occur generally because processes deny each other’s’ resources and none
can proceed to completion. It is a permanent occurrence that cannot be solved
efficiently. In general, there are several ways or strategies to be dealing with deadlock.
One of the ways to show a deadlock representation is by using resource allocation
graphs.
Processes: PA, PB, PC, PD
Resources: R1 (3units), R2 (2 units), R3 (2 units), R4 (3 units)
